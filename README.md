 - __Sample Report__ [link](https://robotmetrics.netlify.com/)

 - Whats new in __v3.2.2__ [link](https://github.com/adiralashiva8/robotframework-metrics/releases/tag/v3.2.2)

---

#### How it Works:

1. Read output.xml file using robotframework API

2. Get Suite, Test Case , Keyword , Status and Elapsed time values

3. Convert data to html report using Beautifulsoup

---

#### How to use in project:

__Step 1__ Install robotmetrics 

   > Case 1: Using pip
   ```
   pip install robotframework-metrics==3.2.2 (from RF4.0)
   pip install robotframework-metrics==3.2.0 (below RF4.0)
   ```
   > Case 2: Using setup.py (clone project and run command within root)
   ```
   python setup.py install
   ```
   > Case 3: For latest changes use following command (pre-release or changes in master)
   ```
   pip install git+https://github.com/adiralashiva8/robotframework-metrics
   ```

__Step 2__ Execute robotmetrics command to generate report

   > Case 1: No change in output.xml, log.html file name's and user is in same folder
   ```
   robotmetrics
   ```
   > Case 2: Change in output.xml, log.html file name's And .xml and .html files are under 'Result' folder
   ```
   robotmetrics --inputpath ./Result/ --output output1.xml --log log1.html
   ```
   robotframework-metrics can parse multiple xmls at a time. Following is the command
   ```
   robotmetrics --inputpath ./Result/ --output "output1.xml,output2.xml" --log log1.html
   ```

   > For more info on command line options use:

   ```
   robotmetrics --help
   ```

__Step 3__ RobotFramework Metrics Report __metric-timestamp.html__ file will be created in current folder | `-inputpath` if specified

   Note: From v3.1.6 users can specify __custom_report_name__ instead of __metrics-timestamp.html__
   ```
   robotmetrics -M regression_metrics.html
   ```
---

#### Customize Report

Specify Logo in Robotframework metrics: 

 - __Custom Logo__ : Customize your logo by using --logo command line option

     ```
     --logo "https://mycompany/logo.jpg"
     ```
---

#### Exclude Keywords in Metrics Report

 - From `v3.1.6` users can exclude keywords in metrics report using `--ignorekeywords` or `-k` command

   ```
   robotmetrics -k True
   ```
   > By default `--ignorekeywords` is `False`

---

#### Exclude Logs in Metrics Report

 - From `v3.1.7` users can exclude Logs tab in metrics report using `--ignorelogs` or `-l` command

   ```
   robotmetrics -l True
   ```
   > By default `--ignorelogs` is `False`

---

#### Include Full Suite Name in Metrics Report

 - From `v3.1.7` users can include full suite name in metrics report using `--fullsuitename` or `-s` command

   ```
   robotmetrics -s True
   ```
   > By default `--fullsuitename` is `False`

---

#### Generate robotframework-metrics after execution

Execute robotmetrics command after suite or test execution as follows:

 - Create .bat (or) .sh file with following snippet

    ```
    robot test.robot &
    robotmetrics [:options]
    ```

    > & is used to execute multiple command's in .bat file

  - Modify robotmetrics command as required and execute .bat file

  - Robotframework metrics will be created after execution
